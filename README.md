# Temperature Monitor IoT:


The problem:
Unbalanced temperature distribution in workspaces.

# Requirements:
- hardware:
Raspberry pi2
BMP20 temperature and pressure sensor
Ethernet connection

- Software:
Windows 10: IoT Core
Azure IoT Hub
Document DB
Power BI


# How this is going to be applied?
Heating/Cooling system implementation.
Diagnosing any faults in the cooling system.
A possibility of connecting to thermostats to control temperature


# Features:
Low cost integrated solution for cooling/heating systems.
Real-time tracking form the temperature (and possibly light) sensors.
Cloud based solution which allow access from any where.
Easy-to-read and powerful dashboards using Power BI.
Machine Learning can be applied to predict the optimum cooling implementation.


# The flow of data:
1.Temperature Sensor on raspberry pi2
2.Azure IoT Hub
3.Stream Analytics
4.Power BI and Document DB
